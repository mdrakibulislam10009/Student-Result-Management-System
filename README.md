Student Result Management System (SRMS)

A desktop-based academic record management application built using Python Tkinter and SQLite3. It provides an easy way to handle student details, course information, and examination results in one place.

📘 Description

SRMS allows administrators to manage student records through a user-friendly interface. It supports secure login, registration, and password recovery. Users can navigate to different modules and perform add, update, delete, and search operations smoothly.
